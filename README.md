# Occupancy_detection
Project for Intelligent systems' course.
I used Keras library to train a MLP to detect if there are one or more people in a room based on data read from several sensors. The dataset is from UCI Machine learning repo (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+)

The network achieves nearly .98 accuracy on the test set.
